# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
## 📋Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in data science and machine learning. This project includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Visualization of survival patterns

Analysis of demographic and socioeconomic factors affecting survival



---

### 🔑Key Features

Data Cleaning: Missing values handled appropriately (e.g., Age, Embarked).

EDA Techniques: Distribution plots, count plots, and more.

Visualizations: Insights into survival rates by gender, class, family relationships, and fare.



---

### Technologies Used

Python: Programming language

Pandas: For data manipulation

NumPy: For numerical operations

Matplotlib: For data visualization

Seaborn: For advanced visualizations



---

### 📊Steps of Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning

Missing values in the Age column were filled with the median.

The Embarked column was filled with the most frequent value.

The Cabin column was dropped due to a high percentage of missing values.


### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Survival Analysis:

Overall survival rate

Survival rates by gender and class

Family relationships' impact on survival (SibSp, Parch)


### Demographics Analysis:

Age distribution

Fare distribution


### Embarkation Analysis:

Survival rates by embarkation port




---

### Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:

1. Survival Rate Count


2. Survival Rate by Gender


3. Age Distribution


4. Survival Rate by Class


5. Family Relationships and Survival (SibSp, Parch)


6. Fare Distribution


7. Embarkation Port and Survival

### Results

Key insights from the analysis:

1. Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.


2. Class: First-class passengers had a higher survival rate compared to second and third-class passengers.


3. Age: Children had a higher chance of survival.


4. Family: Passengers with small families had better survival chances compared to those traveling alone or with large families.
